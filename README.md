# Calculator
A Python Implementation of a simple calculator. This program outputs a GUI calculator that takes input from the user, and evaluates
the expression using Eval(), or returns "ERROR" if it is an invalid statement (such as dividing by 0). This project was good practice to
improve my use of GUI in Python,which is useful in many softwares.
